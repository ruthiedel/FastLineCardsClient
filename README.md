# Tab Project

Mini project developed as part of training at FAST LINE.

## Overview
This project is a simple web application where users can manage a personal tab repository. It includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete their tabs. The frontend is built with React.js, and it interacts with a Node.js server, which is located in a separate repository.

## Features
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All functionality is contained on a single page for a seamless user experience.
- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - Create new tabs
  - View list of all tabs
  - Update existing tabs
  - Delete tabs
- **Backend Integration**: The frontend communicates with a Node.js backend to manage the tab data.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js Server**: Manages the data and handles CRUD requests (located in a separate repository).
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For scripting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) should be installed on your machine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
